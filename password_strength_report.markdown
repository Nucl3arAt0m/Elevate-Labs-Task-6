# Password Strength Report - Elevate Labs Task 6

## Task Overview
- **Objective**: Create and evaluate passwords for Day 6 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship (July 1, 2025).
- **Tool Used**: Passwordmeter.com.
- **Goal**: Test passwords of varying complexity, identify best practices, and summarize security impact.

## Password Strength Results
Tested five passwords on [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com):

1. **Password 1: `password123`**
   - **Score**: ~20% (Weak)
   - **Feedback**: Common word, short length, lacks symbols.
   - **Issues**: Vulnerable to dictionary and brute force attacks.

2. **Password 2: `HelloWorld`**
   - **Score**: ~30% (Weak)
   - **Feedback**: Lacks numbers and symbols, dictionary words used.
   - **Issues**: Easily cracked by dictionary attacks.

3. **Password 3: `P@ssw0rd2025`**
   - **Score**: ~60% (Medium)
   - **Feedback**: Good mix of characters, but predictable pattern.
   - **Issues**: Moderate resistance to brute force, still guessable.

4. **Password 4: `Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r`**
   - **Score**: ~85% (Strong)
   - **Feedback**: Long, diverse characters, no dictionary words.
   - **Issues**: Strong but requires memorization or password manager.

5. **Password 5: `Cyb3r$ecur1ty_Rul3z#2025`**
   - **Score**: ~95% (Very Strong)
   - **Feedback**: Long, complex, diverse characters, excellent entropy.
   - **Issues**: None, ideal for high-security accounts.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- **Length**: Minimum 12 characters.
- **Diversity**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Avoid Predictability**: No common words, patterns, or personal info.
- **Passphrases**: Use random word combinations (e.g., `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple`).
- **No Reuse**: Unique passwords per account.

## Tips Learned
- Use passphrases for memorability and strength.
- Avoid dictionary words or repetitive characters.
- Test passwords with tools like passwordmeter.com.
- Use a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden) to generate/store complex passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries all possible combinations.
  - **Impact**: Short passwords (e.g., `password123`) crack in seconds.
  - **Mitigation**: Increase length and complexity.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words/phrases.
  - **Impact**: Predictable passwords (e.g., `HelloWorld`) are vulnerable.
  - **Mitigation**: Avoid dictionary words, add random characters.

## Password Complexity and Security
- **Complexity**: Mixed characters increase entropy, resisting brute force (e.g., `Cyb3r$ecur1ty_Rul3z#2025` takes years to crack vs. seconds for `password123`).
- **Length**: Each additional character exponentially increases cracking time.
- **Diversity**: Thwarts dictionary attacks by avoiding predictable patterns.
- **Security**: Strong passwords, paired with MFA, significantly reduce unauthorized access risks.

## Learnings
- **Password Strength**: Long, complex passwords are critical for security.
- **Attacks**: Brute force and dictionary attacks exploit weak passwords.
- **Next Steps**: Adopt password managers and MFA for all accounts.
